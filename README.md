## 🚀 Deployment Notes (GitHub Pages)

If you're using GitHub Pages with a subdirectory (like `/interchange/`), make sure:

- All internal links use **relative paths** (e.g., `./about.html`)
- All referenced assets (CSS, JS, images) also use relative or root-aware paths
- You don’t rely on dynamic routing (e.g., React Router or Vue Router) — this is a static multi-page site
