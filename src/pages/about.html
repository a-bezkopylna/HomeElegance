                            A quality sofa is paramount in addressing upper and lower back pain. Conversely, an unsuitable mattress can initiate or worsen these discomforts, which is significant given the 7-9 hours typically spent in bed each night. When selecting the best mattress for alleviating back pain, there are four essential factors to consider: comfort, pressure point relief, spinal alignment, and robust support.
